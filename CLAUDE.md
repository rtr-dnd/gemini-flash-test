# Claude Development Guidelines

## Project Overview: GoogLM

**GoogLM** is a Google-inspired search interface powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite AI model. The project demonstrates how AI can power every aspect of a search engine, creating a complete search experience with AI-generated suggestions and results.

### Core Features
- **Homepage**: Google-style landing page with centered search box and GoogLM branding
- **Search Results Page**: Complete search results generated by AI, with Japanese localization
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Real-time search suggestions using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- **AI-Generated Results**: Full search result pages with titles, URLs, descriptions, and metadata
- **IME Support**: Proper Japanese input composition handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface matching Google's UX patterns

### Technical Stack
- **Next.js 15.0.3**: App Router with TypeScript
- **React 18**: Modern hooks and component patterns
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Google Generative AI SDK**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite integration
- **Japanese Localization**: UI elements and AI responses in Japanese

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting and Formatting
- **IMPORTANT**: After generating or modifying any code, ALWAYS run `npm run lint:fix` to ensure proper formatting and fix any linting issues
- This command should be executed automatically after any code changes to maintain consistent code style
- Fix any ESLint errors before considering the task complete

### Development Workflow
1. Write/modify code
2. Run `npm run lint:fix` 
3. Fix any remaining errors manually if needed
4. Verify the code builds and runs correctly

## Project Architecture

### File Structure
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Homepage with search functionality
- `src/app/search/page.tsx`: Search results page
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Main application layout
- `src/app/api/search/route.ts`: AI-powered search results API
- `src/app/api/suggestions/route.ts`: AI-powered suggestions API
- `src/components/GoogLMLogo.tsx`: Custom logo component (multi-colored SVG)
- `src/components/SearchBox.tsx`: Reusable search input with suggestions (homepage/header variants)
- `src/components/SearchResultItem.tsx`: Individual search result display

### Key Components

#### SearchBox Component
- Dual variants: homepage (with buttons) and header (compact)
- Real-time AI suggestions with debounced API calls (200ms)
- Full IME composition support for Japanese input
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Accessibility features and focus management

#### AI Integration
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17`
- **Suggestions API**: Generates contextual Japanese search suggestions (up to 8)
- **Search Results API**: Creates realistic search results with titles, URLs, descriptions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Mock data when AI APIs fail
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation of features

### Japanese Localization
- UI elements use Japanese text (検索中, すべて, 画像, ショッピング, etc.)
- AI prompts specifically request Japanese responses
- Proper handling of Japanese character input and composition

## Testing
- Run tests with: (to be determined based on project setup)
- Ensure all tests pass before committing changes

## Environment Variables
- Store sensitive data like API keys in `.env.local`
- Required environment variables:
  - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key for search results generation
- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository

## Development Notes
- Uses Google TypeScript Style (GTS) for linting configuration
- SVGR webpack loader for SVG component imports
- Turbopack for fast development builds
- Progressive enhancement with client-side interactivity
